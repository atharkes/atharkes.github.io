        Hi! My name is Theo Harkes. I believe that this world is created by a divine being we will never fully understand. Still I will probably always try to understand how things go about. Currently I fulfill this need by studying computer science at <a href="https://www.uu.nl/en">Utrecht University</a>.

        My most recent working experience is being a student assistent at <a href="https://www.uu.nl/en">Utrecht University</a>, assisting in courses about datastructures, databases, concurrency, modelling and systems developmentm and optimilization and complexity.

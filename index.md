        Hi! My name is Theo Harkes. I believe that this world is created by a divine being we will never fully understand. Still I will probably always try to understand how things go about. Currently I have been fulfilling this need by studying computer science at <a href="https://www.uu.nl/en">Utrecht University</a>.

        My most recent working experience is being a student assistent at <a href="https://www.uu.nl/en">Utrecht University</a>, assisting in courses about databases, datastructures, graphics, concurrency, modelling and systems development and optimilization and complexity. For more information take a look at my <a href="docs/CV Theo Harkes 2022-08-09.pdf">curriculum vitae</a>.
